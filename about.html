  <h2 class="w3-wide">My name is Alex and I'm an animator and filmmaker. I'm currently studying VFX & Animation at Confetti in Nottingham and this summer I'll be leaving college with a Level 3 BTEC National Diploma in Creative Media Practice. In the near future, I am looking to make a shift into a career in live-action filmmaking and in 2024 I'll be heading to university for film. During the rest of this year, I'd like to spend time travelling and making some films of my own - which will be posted to this website as well as youtube. I thought I'd make Eyes,Nose + Mouth as sort of a label to operate under since It means I can collaborate with people and give them due credit - I don't want other people to work for me to produce my 'creative vision' or anything, I'd rather us make something creative together (and as I begin to work with people I'm sure this site will evolve to a more collective thing). Check out the other pages of this site to see some of my work so far and feel free to get in touch with me at arcnewham@gmail.com or via the contact page of this site. </h2>
